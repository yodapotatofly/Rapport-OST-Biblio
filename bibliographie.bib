abstract = {In this paper, an extensive state of the art review of different access control solutions in IoT within the Objectives, Models, Architecture and Mechanisms (OM-AM) way is provided. An analysis of the security and privacy requirements for the most dominant IoT application domains, including Personal and home, Government and utilities, and Enterprise and industry, is conducted. The pros and cons of traditional, as well as recent access control models and protocols from an IoT perspective are highlighted. Furthermore, a qualitative and a quantitative evaluation of the most relevant IoT related-projects that represent the majority of research and commercial solutions proposed in the field of access control conducted over the recent years (2011- 2016) is achieved. Finally, potential challenges and future research directions are defined.}
